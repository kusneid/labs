Immortal temptation takes over my mind
Condemned
Fallen weak on my knees, summon the strength
Of mayhem
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
