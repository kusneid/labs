Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette
Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes
The puppet master congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power? Then come try and take it
