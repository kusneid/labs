Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can't run away
Keep walking the line between the light
Led astray
Through vacant halls, I won't surrender
The truth revealed in eyes of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost, and now they remember
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds and isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
